# HW-Tracking-Website-App
For those too lazy to write down their HW.

Often times I do not have enough time to note down the homework as I hurry into the next class, so I rely on my classmates over wechat or the official SMIC website. However, those can be unreliable at times.

Although I don't have an concrete idea yet, I imagine it would be similar to titanpad.

I plan on learning and using python for this project. This project is mostly an introductory project for me to learn python.
